# Omnibar feature inventory

What the omnibar does today. This is a behaviour contract, not a design
document: if a change removes a line from this file, that removal must be
deliberate.

Rewritten after the concept work in `omnibar-concept.md` landed. The five panes
described by the previous version are gone; see section 1 and section 11.

Scope: `packages/client/src/components/layout/GlobalOmnibar.tsx`, the surfaces
under `components/layout/omnibar/`, the `lib/omnibar-*.ts` modules, and the
server route that backs cross-chat message search.

Related documents: `omnibar-concept.md` (the rules this shape follows),
`omnibar-implementation-plan.md` (how it was built),
`omnibar-workflow-slice-plan.md` (why the 11 slices exist),
`omnibar-completion-recovery-design.md`,
`omnibar-command-center-professor-mari-plan.md`,
`omnibar-improvement-backlog.md` (what to build next, and why).

## 1. Surfaces

One list, and the surfaces that take it over. The persisted `pane` holds three
values.

| Surface | Purpose | Entered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `results` | The ranked result list. The default, and every open starts here. | Open, or Escape from a takeover |
| `browse` | Grid of one category, with compare and batch attach. | A category chip with an empty query, or the Browse button |
| `mari` | Professor Mari's work surface. | The Mari button, `⌘↵`, a row's Sparkles button, a Mari-owned row, or the Ask-Mari row |

Two things render **inside** the list rather than replacing it:

- **Inline expansion.** A focused row grows to show its preview, or a choice
  control's options. The row itself grows; rows above it never move.
- **The aside.** A cheap answer pinned to the bottom of the panel, below the
  list and above the footer. It is not a row: never ranked, never in the
  arrow-key cycle, never the target of Enter.

Rules that must survive:

- The omnibar always reopens on the list. A persisted `mari` pane is reset, and
  a session persisted with the removed `detail` or `quick` panes falls back to
  the list.
- Escape collapses an expansion if one is open; otherwise it leaves a takeover;
  otherwise it closes. One level, so Escape and the back arrow always agree.
- Escape from a takeover never cancels a running answer.
- Leaving `mari` restores focus to the row it came from (`mariReturnResultId`),
  falling back to the input.
- The result preview renders from one `renderResultPreview` body in two places:
  inline under the focused row, and in the external panel above 88rem.
- The external panel only appears when the result is "rich": media, prose,
  facts, a control, or lazily fetched detail. It never takes focus and is not
  part of the keyboard model.

## 2. Query handling

- Input is deferred (`useDeferredValue`) so typing paints before the
  search, rank and present pipeline reruns.
- **Scope prefixes** (`lib/omnibar-scope.ts`): `faq:`, `docs:`, `msg:`, `chat:`,
  `char:`, `persona:`, `lore:`, `preset:`, `conn:`, `agent:`, `set:`, plus long
  and plural aliases. The colon is required. Everything downstream sees only the
  text after the prefix. A bare prefix with no query lists that whole category.
- **Inline ghost completion**: the first ranked title is completed after the
  cursor, accepted with Tab. With a chat open, an action verb completes to the
  whole sentence ("add el" → "add Eliza to this chat").
- **Intent parsing** (`lib/omnibar-search.ts`): verbs are classified as
  `navigate`, `action`, `create`, `explain`, `recommend` or `repair`, and an
  object kind in the query ("add character eliza") narrows the search to that
  kind. A bare verb matches nothing by text and is answered by the verb
  suggestion builder instead.
- **Removal versus attach**: `remove`, `drop`, `detach`, `disable` and
  `turn off` are detaching verbs. "disable Tavern" never offers to attach it.

## 3. Result sources

Every builder is pure and lives in `lib/omnibar-results.ts` unless noted.

| Source | Builder | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entities: chats, characters, personas, lorebooks, presets, connections, agents | `lib/omnibar-entity-rows.ts` | `preview` stays a thunk, built only for the focused row |
| App commands and personal extensions | `data.commands` | Extension commands come from `personal-extension-contributions` |
| Settings destinations | `lib/omnibar-settings.ts` | 6 sections and 25 named controls, each deep-linking to a tab and control id |
| Quick controls | `buildOmnibarControlResults` | Theme and presence as choices; 9 toggles |
| Active-chat controls | `buildOmnibarChatControlResults` | Model, preset, persona (choices, capped at 6 plus the current value) and an agents toggle. These edit the chat in place — nothing navigates away |
| FAQ | `buildOmnibarSearchResults` | Ids are `faq:<id>`; opens the FAQ viewer modal |
| Documentation | `useDocsCommandSearchProvider` | Passage search; opens the docs viewer at the match |
| Messages in the open chat | `buildOmnibarMessageResults` | Client-side over the shared transcript cache; 3-character minimum, 6 results |
| Messages in every other chat | `buildOmnibarGlobalMessageResults` | Server-backed; see section 6 |
| Professor Mari's own conversations | `buildOmnibarMariChatResults` | They sit behind an internal marker and are absent from the chat list |
| Slash commands | `buildOmnibarSlashResults` | Chat surface only. Choosing one types it into the chat input rather than running it, so arguments stay visible |
| Context rows | `buildOmnibarContextResults` | "What am I on?": the open editor, the current chat and everything attached to it, the last error, an unfinished creation session |
| Idle rows | `buildOmnibarIdleResults` | Unfinished setup first (capped at 2), then recents, then surface commands |
| Verb, attach and detach suggestions | `buildOmnibarVerbSuggestions`, `buildOmnibarAddSuggestions`, `buildOmnibarRemovalSuggestions` | Answer a half-typed sentence |
| Creation proposal | `lib/omnibar-creation-proposal.ts` | Nothing is created until accepted |
| Chat-to-world extraction | `lib/omnibar-chat-extraction.ts` | Lorebook, characters, locations or campaign |
| Game commands | `lib/omnibar-game-commands.ts` | Party, quest, scene and encounter topics go to Mari with the live game state. Dice are deliberately absent — see section 11 |
| Choice values | `lib/omnibar-choice-rows.ts` | With a query typed, every choice control's options join the searchable set, so "gpt" reaches GPT-4 without finding the Model row first. They stay out of the idle deck. Each row carries its own `chooseValue`, so a row found by typing works when its control is nowhere on screen |
| "Ask Professor Mari" fallback | `buildOmnibarSearchResults` | Always last unless promoted. Opens Mari's takeover. The cheap answer arrives on its own, in the aside — see section 12 |
| "Continue with Mari" | `buildOmnibarContinueResult` | Only when Mari is active or has pending approvals |

De-duplication is by result id, first source wins. Message rows from the open
chat and from the global search share an id shape on purpose, so a hit is never
listed twice.

## 4. Ranking

Score is the source score plus a context bonus plus an intent bonus, then the
shared command ranking (recency and pins) reorders it.

- Text scoring prefers exact title, then prefix, then whole word, then substring.
- Context bonuses, highest first: the open resource (80, or "unsaved changes"
  when the editor is dirty), the current settings target (80), something used by
  the active chat (55), something related to a current error (50), available
  setup (35), the current screen (30), pinned (25), recent (15). The winning
  reason becomes the row's context label.
- Pins are ignored while a query is typed, so typing always beats a pin.
- "Ask Professor Mari" is promoted above the hits when the query reads like a
  question, when the intent is explain, recommend or repair, or when nothing
  matched well — unless one result is a clear direct hit (score ≥ 250 with a
  navigate, action or create intent).
- That promotion is also the aside's trigger (section 12). It is read back from
  the ranked list, not recomputed, so the two can never disagree.

## 5. Actions

Typed actions (`OmnibarAction`) dispatch through `runResultAction`; results
without one fall through to the generic open path.

- `open-mari-chat`, `slash`, `goto-message`, `add-to-chat`, `detach-from-chat`,
  `refine-query`, `personal-extension`, `open-docs`, `open-faq`.
- A row with `chooseValue` applies that value and is checked before any other
  path. It exists so a choice option works wherever it was found.
- Direct active-chat actions: "add Eliza" with a chat open attaches instead of
  opening, but only when the result is unambiguous.
- Attach and detach reuse the drag-and-drop payload and its block rules, so the
  omnibar can never make an assignment a drop would refuse.
- Every navigation passes the dirty-editor confirmation.
- Batch attach: a same-kind browse selection attaches to the active chat in one
  payload. Compare sends 2 to 5 selected items to Mari.
- Preview actions per category: start chat, edit, add to or remove from this
  chat, activate persona, set default preset, enable or disable, resume chat,
  open documentation, continue with Mari.

## 6. Cross-chat message search

- Route: `GET /api/chats/search/messages?q=&limit=` (static path, matched ahead
  of `/:id/messages`). Query capped at 200 characters, limit clamped to 1..50,
  default 20.
- `collectMessageSearchHits` in `services/storage/chats.storage.ts` is pure and
  self-checked in `chats.storage.test.ts`. It walks the whole message list in
  order, counting a per-chat position for **every** message — system and hidden
  rows included — because `messageNumber` is the absolute position the
  goto-message jump takes. Only visible rows in visible chats are returned.
- Matching is a literal, case-insensitive substring. It deliberately does not
  use `like()`, whose `%` and `_` are wildcards.
- The snippet is windowed around the match, not cut from the start.
- Professor Mari's chats are excluded inside the search, before the cap, so they
  cannot crowd out ordinary hits.
- The client only calls it at 3 characters or more, and never for a scope other
  than `msg:`.
- Choosing a hit in another chat opens that chat and then jumps: the goto request
  is keyed by chat id and survives the switch.
- Known ceiling, marked `ponytail:` in the source: one full in-memory pass per
  query. Add an index if a large library makes typing lag.

## 7. Keyboard and pointer

This is the part most likely to break silently. All of it must survive.

- `↑`/`↓` move the selection; `Home`/`End` jump to the ends. Not in browse.
- `Enter` chooses. On a toggle row it flips the toggle; on a choice row it
  expands the row's options beneath it; on an option row it applies that value.
- `⌘↵` / `Ctrl+↵` continues the selected result with Mari, skipping the detail
  pane. Not offered for admin-only rows.
- `→` expands a choice row's options, or a rich row's preview, in place. `←`
  collapses whichever is open, and otherwise returns focus to the input.
- **Expanded content is inserted below the focused row, never above it.** The
  focused row does not move, so `reconcileActiveResultId` stays valid and the
  two rules below cannot be violated by an expansion.
- `Tab` accepts the ghost completion when there is one; otherwise it cycles
  focus inside the dialog (the dialog traps focus).
- `Escape` collapses an expansion, then leaves a takeover, then closes.
- In browse, `↓` moves focus into the grid and `Enter` activates the first cell.
- Native browser autocomplete is off on the input, because its popup steals the
  arrow keys.
- **Hover needs genuinely new screen coordinates.** Keyboard navigation scrolls
  the list under a resting cursor and the browser fires a mousemove for the row
  that slid beneath it; treating that as hover drags the selection back.
- **Arrow keys anchor on the highlight, not on DOM focus.** Hover moves the
  highlight without moving focus, so counting from the focused row would jump.
- The selection is pinned across re-renders by `reconcileActiveResultId`; the
  input's `onChange` must never null it.
- The active row is kept in view with `scrollIntoView({ block: "nearest" })`.

## 8. State and persistence

- Session state (`query`, `filter`, `pane`, `activeResultId`, `browseSelectedId`,
  `browseLimit`, `detailResultId`, `mariReturnResultId`, `mariHandoff`,
  `mariDestination`, `mariDetailId`) survives a close and reopen, except the
  `mari` pane reset above.
- Both expansions — the focused row's preview and a choice row's options — are
  component state, not session state. Every open starts from a bare list.
- Command ranking (recency and pins) is persisted separately.
- UI-store slots the omnibar reads: `activeEditorField`, `lastAppError`,
  `creationSession`, the open-detail ids per resource kind, the settings target.

## 9. Accessibility

- The dialog is modal, labelled, and traps focus.
- A polite live region announces result counts, loading, and partial failure.
- Groups are sections with labelled headings.
- Every icon-only button has an accessible label.
- Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion` throughout.

## 10. Performance constraints

- `preview` is always a thunk. Building preview data eagerly for every entity
  undoes the whole point.
- Row lookups are keyed by result id; a linear scan per rendered row showed up
  on large libraries.
- `chatControls` depends on the stable `mutateAsync` functions, not on the
  mutation objects, which are new every render.
- The bundle budget in `vite.config.ts` is a hard `this.error`, not a warning:
  500 kB per chunk, 1000 kB per entry. It measures `chunk.code` in memory, which
  is **not** the size printed in the build log — the same GameSurface chunk reads
  492 kB to the budget and 509 kB in the log. Debug budget failures with the
  budget's own numbers.
- `OmnibarMariPane`, `OmnibarBrowsePane` and `OmnibarAside` are lazy and mounted
  behind `Suspense`. So are Mari's Skills and Memories panels, which most
  sessions never open.

## 11. Deliberate non-features

Do not "fix" these; each was a decision.

- No "switch to game mode" action: game mode has a setup wizard and there is no
  safe one-call mode setter.
- The completion-action catalog never emits `show-field`. That branch is
  unreachable — do not re-add it.
- Image generation failures are not wired into error recovery: they are
  swallowed `catch {}` blocks with no single user-visible point.
- Message search does not rank by relevance, only by recency.
- **The omnibar does not roll dice.** It once did, and the branch was removed.
  The game input bar already has a Dices button with eight presets and a custom
  notation field, on the only screen where an omnibar roll was ever offered, and
  its roll queues onto your turn so the model sees the result — the omnibar's
  did not. Restoring it would also restore a dynamic-import rule, because a
  static import of the game stores from here breaks the bundle budget.

- **There is no detail pane.** A preview expands under its own row instead. The
  pane hid the whole list on narrow screens to show one result, and on wide
  screens the external panel already did the job without it.
- **There is no Quick pane.** The aside answers the cheap case without being
  asked, and the Ask-Mari row opens the takeover. Quick's one surviving job — a
  single-field rewrite from one model call — moved into Mari's takeover, where
  the proposal lands in the pending-change dock like every other change she
  makes. That costs more than one call, deliberately, for one review surface.
- **There is no floating Mari window.** What is left of it is a presence
  indicator that shows state and opens her. She cannot sit beside an open
  editor; she is a place you go.
- **Escape does not walk a pane stack.** There is one level to step back from.
- **Her sprite does not appear on messages.** One sprite, in the header, where
  its pose carries her state. Her transcript rows are labelled instead.
- **A prose rewrite is not painted red and green.** That reads as
  wrong-and-right, when it is a rewrite. Structural changes keep diff colouring.

## 12. The aside

The cheap answer, `hooks/use-omnibar-aside.ts` and
`components/layout/omnibar/OmnibarAside.tsx`.

- Fires only when the Ask-Mari row is promoted — a question-shaped query, an
  `explain` / `recommend` / `repair` intent, or no direct hit at score ≥ 250 —
  and only after the input has been idle. One predicate, already tuned, read
  back from the ranked list rather than duplicated.
- The delay is a knob, not a constant. Default 3s. Too short spends a call on an
  ordinary typing pause; too long makes the feature feel absent.
- **The unasked call is a different call, not a trimmed one.**
  `buildQuickContextPayload` assembles it from scratch: the surface, the typed
  query, and the focused resource's label. It must never carry persistent
  memories or the contents of the focused field, both of which an *asked* Quick
  call does send. `quick-context-payload.test.ts` pins this.
- Defaults to the local sidecar, so nothing is spent unasked.
- Nothing is front-loaded into onboarding. The first answer says where it came
  from and offers to turn the feature off, in place.
- A failed call shows one quiet line and the `shrug` sprite. Never a toast — the
  user did not ask for this call — and the ranked list is never degraded by it.
- `⌘↵` needs no special case: when the aside fires, the promoted Ask-Mari row is
  the selection, so continuing it already opens the takeover.
